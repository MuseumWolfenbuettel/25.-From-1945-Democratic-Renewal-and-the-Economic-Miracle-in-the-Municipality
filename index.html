            The post-war years in Wolfenbüttel were defined by the democratization of society, the reception and integration of a large number of refugees and displaced persons, and the economic reconstruction of the region. The era of the German economic miracle brought unexpected and sustained growth, which soon elevated the standard of living for a broad swath of the population. Companies such as Jägermeister and Kuba-Tonmöbel became emblematic of this transformative period.
Gerhard Kubetschek, founder of Kuba and a refugee from Silesia, exemplified the significant contributions newcomers made to the renewal of an old city. Following the consequences of the Second World War, Wolfenbüttel became a new home for a considerable number of refugees and displaced individuals. By 1948, nearly one in three Wolfenbüttel residents was a new citizen. Entire neighborhoods, such as Breslauer Straße and Marienburgweg, emerged to accommodate this growing population.
While new developments arose on the outskirts of the city, Wolfenbüttel’s historic old town was characterized by half-timbered houses, many of which were in a state of severe disrepair. A comprehensive urban renewal program launched in the late 1970s ultimately arrested the decay of the old town, preserving its architectural heritage.
Wolfenbüttel also found itself in the shadow of the German-German border during the Cold War, a geographical and political reality that shaped the city for decades. However, German reunification after 1990 fundamentally altered this dynamic. The city’s history as a garrison town also came to an end, as both the British Rhine Army and the German Bundeswehr left Wolfenbüttel in 1994.
The site of the former barracks on Salzdahlumer Straße was transformed into the campus of the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, signaling a new dimension in the structural transformation of the city.
